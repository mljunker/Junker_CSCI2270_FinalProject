# Junker_CSCI2270_FinalProject
This will be a kingdom building game using a tree to store each location in a way that represents its location relative to the other known locations.
Operations on the tree will include adding a node by conquering a new location, deleting a node by losing a location, and printing all conquered locations to asses the extent of the kingdom.
